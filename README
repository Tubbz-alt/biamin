If you want to hunt down evil bugs and become a debug warrior:

The fastest way is to leave a comment on our git repo at
https://gitorious.org/back-in-a-minute
But you may also leave a comment on http://sigg3.net/biamin/bugs

To debug biamin and help us make it better, run biamin like this:

$ bash -x biamin.sh p 2>log

Explanation:
    bash      -> run biamin using BASH
    -x        -> use BASH's debugger
    biamin.sh -> biamin :)
    p         -> play (run ./biamin --help)
    2>log     -> redirect STDERR to file 'log'

When you've found a bug, you can either send the log to us or use any
pastebin service and provide us with a link. This improves the chances
of our catching the error and fixing it, and it makes the gods happy!

WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE, AND HOWEVER YOU ROLL, THANKS FOR PLAYING!
