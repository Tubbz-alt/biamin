If you want to debug biamin:

At any case you can send message through http://sigg3.net/biamin/bugs
or any other way, but fastest is to leave a comment on
https://gitorious.org/back-in-a-minute . But the best way to debug
(and help us make biamin better :) ) is to run biamin as

$ bash -x biamin.sh p 2>log

bash      -> run biamin using BASH
-x        -> use BASH's debugger
biamin.sh -> biamin :)
p         -> play (run ./biamin --help)
2>log     -> redirect STDERR to file 'log'

and send 'log' to us (or use any pastebin servise and sent link) if
you'll meet any bugs. It's really easier to understand what is wrong
when you have debugger output.

And at any case:
WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE, AND HOWEVER YOU ROLL, THANKS FOR PLAYING!
