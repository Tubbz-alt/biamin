Biamin repo structure:

master
  |
  +- dev
  |   |
  |   +- experimental
  |
  +- text


master:
    compiled biamin.sh viz. official releases managed by sigg3
    this README file
    CHANGELOG file generated from development

development:
    individual .sh code chunks
    MakeFile
    
experimental:
    new experimental features get their own branch under dev
    there is no single 'experimental' named branch however

text:
    backup of background story files, world maps and esoteric contents

Sometimes it makes sense to have different repos. We have the GPL-only
and legacy editions of Biamin in separate repos.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Biamin versioning system:

Version changes only in master branch - 1.2.3
1 - Official releases that are publicized on sigg3.net/biamin
2 - Feature added or major code overhauls
3 - Bugfixes, minor edits, commenting, formatting, etc.

Please use one of the following commit conventions:
o ADDED/FEATURE for new features
o BUGFIX        for bugfixes
o FIXED/EDIT    for code making a feature work correctly
o COMMENT       for code comments
o FORMATTING    for code formatting changes
o MINOR         for minor edits, cosmetics
o RELEASE       for public relases (entails version change)
o REMOVED/MOVED/MERGED etc. for various file manipulations      
0 TODO          flagging things TODO, now or in future (e.g. TODO v. 4)

+ short informative description, preferably including .sh or function!

If you want to hunt down evil bugs and become a debug warrior:

The fastest way is to leave a comment on our git repo at
https://gitorious.org/back-in-a-minute
But you may also leave a comment on http://sigg3.net/biamin/bugs

To debug biamin and help us make it better, run biamin like this:

$ bash -x biamin.sh p 2>log

Explanation:
    bash      -> run biamin using BASH
    -x        -> use BASH's debugger
    biamin.sh -> biamin :)
    p         -> play (run ./biamin --help)
    2>log     -> redirect STDERR to file 'log'

Also to have

$ tail -f log

in another terminal is very usable.

When you've found a bug, you can either send the log to us or use any
pastebin service and provide us with a link. This improves the chances
of our catching the error and fixing it, and it makes the gods happy!

WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE, AND HOWEVER YOU ROLL, THANKS FOR PLAYING!
