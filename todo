[ ] Replace bash's pseudo-random RANDOM to smth more random.
[-] Gods ???  (I'm putting this under Mythology)
[?] (S)ettings
[?]	  Show math / Show only text in FightMode()
[?] Other WorldChangeEVENTS ?
[?]	Hurricane - see lower
[?] Quests?
[?] 	  Kill the dragon and get 500 gold (bullutin0)
[?] Messenger?
[?] Date - internal date not attached to real - one turn - one day
[.] Weather - changes every turn.
	The Biamin weather has two systems making a more dynamic experience:
	a) General, seasonal weather (universal = for entire map)
	b) Moving storm system, see WorldWeatherSystem()
		The WorldWeatherSystem() must tie into seasonal variations too.
[?]	Sunny (-FLEE for dwarves, -ENEMY_FLEE if player is human, elf, hobbit, +EN_FLEE if player is dwarf. ec race depended LIGHT bonus (for enemy also)
[?]	Rain (+/-FLEE, more chanses but less HP from REST)
[?]	Thunderstorm (less chances to move, chance to go astray (player press East, but lose his way and go North)
[?]	Wind (+/- FLEE from animal enemies - varg, boar)
[?]	Snow (+/-FLEE, greatest chanses but LEAST HP from REST), if MOUNTAIN - player cant go away until the weather changed, chanses to go astray.
[?]	Hurricane - no chances to move, chances to lose some HP, RAREST!; and see lower
[?] Seasons - winter, spring, summer, autumn
[?]	If there was hurricane in summer - WorldEconomicChanges - tobacco and food raises!
[?] Crime (you're WANTED)? Or perhaps curse?
[?] World Map (tiles of maps) for a bigger world
[?] Internal sub-maps (random?) for locations - caves, etc
[?] Caravans from city to city. 
[?]	Player can walk with caravan for money (less chances to battle on the road)
[?]     Player can take work to guard caravan (gets money after, but bigger chances to battle on the road)
[?]	Player cat meet caravan on the road, and buy smth for lower price.
[?]	Player can ROB caravans on the road!!!
[?]		Enemy - merchant/caravan-master???
[?]	Player can meet caravan whet it is robbing and can choose - go avay or help
[?] NPC system to complete the experience of a living place
[?] Talks in tavern ? (good idea but i can't imangine what it should be #kstn)
        I'm thinking about doing this also. Perhaps it would be better to
        create a subsystem of NPC() that populate certain areas, scattered like
        HotzoneDistribute()
[?] Talks with merchants - during buing they add some sentences about last WorldChangeEvents.
[?] Adventure log (optional)
[?] Add possible loot items for wildlife (e.g. pelts, tusks, horns etc.) and create market system around it.
[?] Add stealing from market??? 
    	 Good idea, but we'd have to arrange a fight and new enemy type (shopkeep)..
	 Or he call the police (the guards?) and they throw player from town? (kstn) 
	 We're getting way ahead of ourselves:) Let's just make what we have work first:)
[?] Add item or magic thing which adds 50 to MAX_HEALTH
[?] If ACCURACY == EN_ACCURACY and ENEMY tries to flee player can resolve to let enemy go or not
[?] Different races eats different quantity of FOOD/turn


TODO open ideas for future editions
[ ] HOME = farm, so we should have a farm cycle, to gather food. This is player's extra repo.
	(H)ome has a crop, and depending on weather above the farm, it can go bad or good.
	We can have the player invest Gold in building better irrigation, etc.
	   Who will be work at farm when player is wandering? Or player is some kind or feudal lord with his own pheasants? #kstn

TODO general stuff
[ ] Continue designing a nicer fight prompt
[ ] Continue pruning UI experience (as constant as possible)
